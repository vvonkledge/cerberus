# Define — Cycle 26

## Problem Statement

The dashboard has no persistent navigation — users must manually type URLs or use browser back to move between pages. Add a navigation sidebar so users can access all pages from anywhere in the app.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] A sidebar is visible on all protected pages
- [ ] Sidebar contains links to all 7 protected pages
- [ ] Clicking a sidebar link navigates to the correct page
- [ ] Current page is visually highlighted in the sidebar

## Out of Scope

- Not making the sidebar responsive/collapsible for mobile
- Not adding icons or branding to the sidebar
- Not restructuring existing page components
- Not adding breadcrumbs or secondary navigation
