# Define — Cycle 02

## Problem Statement

The API has no database — set up Turso with local development support and a schema/migration workflow so auth features have a persistence layer to build on.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Local Turso database runs in development
- [ ] API can connect to the local Turso instance
- [ ] One test proves read/write works against the database
- [ ] `docs/` folder contains a guide for local Turso setup and usage

## Out of Scope

- CI/CD pipeline
- Full user schema and migrations
- Production Turso deployment
