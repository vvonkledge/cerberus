# Define — Cycle 09

## Problem Statement

Build the React admin dashboard with pages for viewing/managing roles, permissions, and user-role assignments so there's a UI for the RBAC endpoints that already exist.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dashboard has a roles page that lists all existing roles
- [ ] Admin can create a new role from the dashboard
- [ ] Admin can assign permission strings to a role from the dashboard
- [ ] Admin can assign roles to a user from the dashboard
- [ ] Admin can view a user's resolved permissions from the dashboard

## Out of Scope

- Delete or edit operations for roles, permissions, or user-role assignments
- Authentication or login for the dashboard itself
- Visual polish or responsive styling beyond basic functional layout
