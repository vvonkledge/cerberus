# State

## Goal

Implement core auth flows (register, login, token issue/validate) with a working admin dashboard for role and permission management.

## Position

Monorepo with packages/api and packages/dashboard deployed as a single Cloudflare Worker. CI/CD pipeline runs lint and tests on PRs, deploys per-PR previews with dynamically created Turso databases, auto-deploys staging on merge to main, and deploys production on tag. Each deploy runs `drizzle-kit push` against its environment's Turso database. A cleanup workflow destroys the per-PR database and preview worker on PR close. The per-PR database workflow has been statically verified but not E2E tested — a `TURSO_API_TOKEN` secret must be configured before live testing. Users, refresh_tokens, roles, permissions, role_permissions, and user_roles tables exist. POST /register creates users with PBKDF2-hashed passwords. POST /login verifies credentials and returns an OAuth 2.0-compatible JWT access token (HMAC-SHA256, 1-hour expiry) alongside an opaque refresh token (7-day expiry). POST /refresh exchanges a valid refresh token for a new access token and a new refresh token, revoking the old refresh token (token rotation), and performs eager cleanup of all revoked and expired tokens for that user. POST /revoke invalidates a refresh token. POST /login, POST /register, and POST /refresh are rate-limited via sliding window (10/60s, 5/60s, 10/60s respectively) using Cloudflare KV with in-memory fallback; rate-limited responses include X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset headers. The KV namespace ID in wrangler.jsonc is a placeholder — must be replaced with an actual namespace before deploying. POST /roles creates roles with name and description. GET /roles returns all roles with their permissions. POST /roles/:roleId/permissions assigns permission strings to roles. GET /users returns all users. POST /users/:userId/roles assigns roles to users. GET /users/:userId/permissions resolves the merged set of permission strings from all assigned roles. All crypto uses Web Crypto API with zero external dependencies. JWT_SECRET must be configured as a Workers secret for staging and production. RBAC endpoints are unprotected — no auth middleware guards role or permission management. 44 API tests and 1 dashboard test pass (45 total). React dashboard has four pages: roles list with create form, role detail with permission assignment, users list, and user detail with role assignment and resolved permissions view. Dashboard uses React Router with a navigation layout. No admin-only access control, delete/edit operations for roles or assignments, or dashboard authentication exists. The refresh_tokens table is cleaned up for active users during rotation; inactive users' expired tokens still accumulate.

## Log

- **Cycle 01:** Set up pnpm monorepo with Hono API and React dashboard. All dev, lint, and test scripts work. See `cycles/01/`
- **Cycle 02:** Added Turso database layer with Drizzle ORM and libsql adapter. Local dev via turso dev CLI, tests via in-memory SQLite, Workers compatibility confirmed. See `cycles/02/`
- **Cycle 03:** Added CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions: PR checks (lint + test), per-PR preview deploys, staging on merge to main, production on tag. Hono + React deployed as a single Cloudflare Worker. All 4 criteria verified end-to-end. See `cycles/03/`
- **Cycle 04:** Configured Turso databases for preview, staging, and production. CI/CD deploys now run `drizzle-kit push` before each deploy, and the health endpoint verifies DB connectivity on all environments. See `cycles/04/`
- **Cycle 05:** Implemented per-PR Turso database lifecycle in preview deploys. Cleanup workflow destroys database and worker on PR close. See `cycles/05/`
- **Cycle 06:** Implemented user registration and login with OAuth 2.0-compatible JWT access tokens. All crypto via Web Crypto API with zero new dependencies. All 5 success criteria met with 12 passing tests. See `cycles/06/`
- **Cycle 07:** Added refresh token support with 7-day expiry and revocation. 19 tests pass with zero regressions. See `cycles/07/`
- **Cycle 08:** Added RBAC data model with roles, permissions, and join tables. Four new endpoints for role creation, permission assignment, user-role assignment, and permission resolution. 29 tests pass with zero regressions. See `cycles/08/`
- **Cycle 09:** Built admin dashboard with React Router for RBAC management. All 5 success criteria met with 35 passing tests. See `cycles/09/`
- **Cycle 10:** Added refresh token rotation via revoke-and-reissue. POST /refresh now returns a new refresh token alongside the access token, with the old token invalidated. 37 API tests pass with zero regressions. See `cycles/10/`
- **Cycle 11:** Added eager cleanup of stale refresh tokens during rotation. POST /refresh now deletes all revoked and expired tokens for the user after issuing a new token. 38 API tests pass with zero regressions. See `cycles/11/`
- **Cycle 12:** Added sliding window rate limiting to POST /login (10/60s), POST /register (5/60s), and POST /refresh (10/60s) with Cloudflare KV storage and in-memory fallback. All 7 success criteria met with 44 API tests passing (6 new), zero regressions. See `cycles/12/`
